# 2DMaze_AGC
Reimagining of 3D Monster Maze for the Apollo Guidance Computer

Written in AGC assembly, this program, if woven into two core rope fixed-memory modules, would be able to run on the Apollo Guidance Computer that was central to the Apollo missions, culminating in the moon landing.

Fortunately we do not need a real, working AGC of which only one is known to exist, as we have VirtualAGC and its Javascript port MoonJS.
